    "\n",
    "Recent studies have demonstrated that large-scale climate indices, such as the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), significantly influence the physiology and phenology of marine plankton. While it is established that positive NPGO phases (cold years) generally favor diatom production through enhanced nutrient availability, the specific mechanistic links transferring these basin-scale climate signals to local ecosystem dynamics remain underdefined. This study addresses this gap by shifting focus from interannual statistical correlations to the synoptic-scale physical processes that directly control water column stability and nutrient injection.\n"

    "\n",
    "The Central Strait of Georgia (SoG) represents a complex estuarine system defined by the interplay between strong tidal mixing, wind forcing, and substantial freshwater discharge from the Fraser River. These physical drivers create a highly dynamic environment where water column stratification competes with vertical mixing, determining the availability of light and nutrients for primary producers. Understanding the spatial and temporal variability of these forces is essential for predicting biological responses in this semi-enclosed sea.\n"

Specifically, this study aims to decompose the dominant modes of sea surface salinity variability using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), establish the correlation between these physical modes and nutrient stoichiometry (Nitrate vs. Silicate), and quantify the biological response to storm events during the contrasting summer conditions of 2011 and 2018."

    "To quantify the atmospheric forcing, the wind field was decomposed into along-strait (approximately 305°) and cross-strait components. We applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the modeled Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) field to extract the dominant spatial patterns (EOFs) and temporal evolution (PCs) of salinity variability. These principal components were then statistically correlated with Fraser River discharge rates and wind stress data to attribute specific physical drivers—such as river plumes, wind sloshing, and coastal upwelling—to the observed salinity modes.\n"

Two distinct storm cases were selected from July 2011 and July 2018 to represent different background climate states. The analysis focuses on the short-term evolution of the water column vertical structure and the resulting phytoplankton succession during these high-energy synoptic events."

    "\n",
    "Statistical analysis of the forcing fields reveals that wind energy in the Central SoG is predominantly aligned with the along-strait direction, significantly exceeding the magnitude of cross-strait winds. This directional dominance suggests that wind-driven circulation and sloshing are the primary mechanisms for mechanical energy input, while the Fraser River discharge acts as the primary source of buoyancy, creating a fundamental physical antagonism between wind-induced mixing and river-induced stratification.\n",

Then, we may use a scatter plot of salinity vs nitrate to show that they are highly correlated, meaning that we can use salinity to trace the change of nitrate.\n"

    "The PCA results successfully separated the variability of Sea Surface Salinity into three distinct modes. The first mode, explaining the majority of the variance, is strongly correlated with the Fraser River discharge, representing the freshwater plume extension. The second and third modes show significant correlation with along-strait wind events, capturing the signatures of wind-driven sloshing and coastal upwelling. These modes provide a quantitative framework for distinguishing between buoyancy-driven and wind-driven changes in the surface layer.\n"

    "A critical finding of this section is the distinct biogeochemical signature associated with each physical mode. The river-dominated mode is characterized by low salinity, strong stratification, and high silicate concentrations but relatively low nitrate levels, creating conditions that favor flagellates. In contrast, the wind-driven modes are associated with increased surface salinity and the entrainment of deep, nitrate-rich water, thereby resetting the surface nutrient ratio to favor rapid diatom growth."

    "This physical disturbance resulted in a significant injection of nitrate into the euphotic zone, triggering a distinct post-storm diatom bloom. The model shows that the ecosystem was significantly impacted. Upwelling regions shifted from a flagellate-dominated state to a diatom-dominated state in the days following the wind event, confirming the role of wind mixing as a \"reset\" mechanism for phytoplankton succession. Comparing the 2011 and 2018 events illustrates that while the mechanism of wind-driven supply is consistent, the magnitude of the biological response is sensitive to the pre-existing stability of the environment.\n"

    "The biological response to wind events was not uniform across the Strait. Areas directly under the influence of the Fraser River plume exhibited a damped response due to the intense halocline, which resisted wind mixing. Conversely, regions prone to upwelling or located at the periphery of the plume showed the strongest correlation between wind stress and diatom biomass increase, highlighting the spatial modulation of climate signals by local hydrography."

    "This study synthesizes the results to propose a conceptual model where the seasonal ecology of the SoG is defined by the tension between river-induced stratification (silicate-rich, nitrate-poor) and wind-induced mixing (nitrate-rich). We argue that the \"cold-phase\" advantage described in large-scale climate literature is mechanistically realized through frequent or intense synoptic wind events that disrupt the river plume, alleviate nitrate limitation, and maintain the ecosystem in a diatom-favorable state.\n"

    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the SalishSeaCast model confirms that along-strait winds are the primary driver of vertical nutrient replenishment in the Central Strait of Georgia during summer. By isolating the physical modes of salinity, we demonstrated that wind-driven upwelling and sloshing are critical for counteracting riverine stratification. These physical interruptions are essential for sustaining diatom populations, suggesting that changes in the frequency of summer storms are the direct pathway through which climate variability alters the marine food web."
